- [feature]  PGsql connection error on FreeBSD jailed environments

    In FreeBSD jailed environments the loopback interface can not be used to
    connect to pgsql, because it points to the loopback interface of the host and
    not the jail.

    Thus, it seems to pgsql like the connection is comming from the ip address
    assigned to the jail.

    This ensures that pgsql can be connected to from any host, when
    run on a FreeBSD systems. This this package can be used in FreeBSD
    jailed environments

- [feature] Use log destination param for pgsql

    This commit ensures that `stderr` is used for logging, by
    specifying the command line parameter.

    On FreeBSD this is very important otherwise syslog will be used and
    the db-fixtures will hang as it looks in the expected log file and
    loops forever waiting for a "database is ready" entry to appear...
    `log_destination=stderr` is default on most systems and can be set in
    `postgresql.conf` or given as an command line argument.
